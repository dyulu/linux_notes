######## dmesg: print or control the kernel ring buffer
-C, --clear
   Clear the ring buffer.

-c, --read-clear
   Clear the ring buffer after first printing its contents.

-D, --console-off
   Disable the printing of messages to the console.

-d, --show-delta
   Display the timestamp and the time delta spent between messages. If
   used together with --notime then only the time delta without the
   timestamp is printed.

-E, --console-on
   Enable printing messages to the console.

-e, --reltime
   Display the local time and the delta in human-readable format. Be
   aware that conversion to the local time could be inaccurate (see -T
   for more details).

-F, --file file
   Read the syslog messages from the given file. Note that -F does not
   support messages in kmsg format. The old syslog format is supported
   only.

-f, --facility list
   Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of facilities.
   For example:

   dmesg --facility=daemon

   will print messages from system daemons only. For all supported
   facilities see the --help output.

-H, --human
   Enable human-readable output. See also --color, --reltime and
   --nopager.

-J, --json
   Use JSON output format. The time output format is in "sec.usec"
   format only, log priority level is not decoded by default (use
   --decode to split into facility and priority), the other options to
   control the output format or time format are silently ignored.

-k, --kernel
   Print kernel messages.

-L, --color[=when]
   Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
   or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
   The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
   the --help output. See also the COLORS section below.

-l, --level list
   Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of levels. For
   example:

   dmesg --level=err,warn

   will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
   levels see the --help output.

-n, --console-level level
   Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
   The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For
   all supported levels see the --help output.

   For example, -n 1 or -n emerg prevents all messages, except
   emergency (panic) messages, from appearing on the console. All
   levels of messages are still written to /proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8)
   can still be used to control exactly where kernel messages appear.
   When the -n option is used, dmesg will not print or clear the
   kernel ring buffer.

--noescape
   The unprintable and potentially unsafe characters (e.g., broken
   multi-byte sequences, terminal controlling chars, etc.) are escaped
   in format \x<hex> for security reason by default. This option
   disables this feature at all. It’s usable for example for debugging
   purpose together with --raw. Be careful and don’t use it by
   default.

-P, --nopager
   Do not pipe output into a pager. A pager is enabled by default for
   --human output.

-p, --force-prefix
   Add facility, level or timestamp information to each line of a
   multi-line message.

-r, --raw
   Print the raw message buffer, i.e., do not strip the log-level
   prefixes, but all unprintable characters are still escaped (see
   also --noescape).

   Note that the real raw format depends on the method how dmesg reads
   kernel messages. The /dev/kmsg device uses a different format than
   syslog(2). For backward compatibility, dmesg returns data always in
   the syslog(2) format. It is possible to read the real raw data from
   /dev/kmsg by, for example, the command 'dd if=/dev/kmsg
   iflag=nonblock'.

-S, --syslog
   Force dmesg to use the syslog(2) kernel interface to read kernel
   messages. The default is to use /dev/kmsg rather than syslog(2)
   since kernel 3.5.0.

-s, --buffer-size size
   Use a buffer of size to query the kernel ring buffer. This is 16392
   by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at
   first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the
   kernel buffer to be larger than the default, then this option can
   be used to view the entire buffer.

-T, --ctime
   Print human-readable timestamps.

   Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate! The time source
   used for the logs is not updated after system SUSPEND/RESUME.
   Timestamps are adjusted according to current delta between boottime
   and monotonic clocks, this works only for messages printed after
   last resume.

--since time
   Display record since the specified time. The time is possible to
   specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
   hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
   --ctime for more details.

--until time
   Display record until the specified time. The time is possible to
   specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
   hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
   --ctime for more details.

-t, --notime
   Do not print kernel’s timestamps.

--time-format format
   Print timestamps using the given format, which can be ctime,
   reltime, delta or iso. The first three formats are aliases of the
   time-format-specific options. The iso format is a dmesg
   implementation of the ISO-8601 timestamp format. The purpose of
   this format is to make the comparing of timestamps between two
   systems, and any other parsing, easy. The definition of the iso
   timestamp is: YYYY-MM-DD<T>HH:MM:SS,<microseconds>←+><timezone
   offset from UTC>.

   The iso format has the same issue as ctime: the time may be
   inaccurate when a system is suspended and resumed.

-u, --userspace
   Print userspace messages.

-w, --follow
   Wait for new messages. This feature is supported only on systems
   with a readable /dev/kmsg (since kernel 3.5.0).

-W, --follow-new
   Wait and print only new messages.

-x, --decode
   Decode facility and level (priority) numbers to human-readable
   prefixes.

-h, --help
   Display help text and exit.

-V, --version
   Print version and exit.
