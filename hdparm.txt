hdparm -I /dev/sda

# Test drive speed
$ hdparm -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads: 1626 MB in  3.00 seconds = 541.85 MB/sec
$ hdparm --direct -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 1564 MB in  3.00 seconds = 520.83 MB/sec
# --offset: Offsets to given number of GiB (1024*1024*1024) when performing -t timings of device reads.

# Test drive cache read speed
$ hdparm -T /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   14150 MB in  2.00 seconds = 7091.92 MB/sec

# Enable read-ahead

# Disable read-ahead
hdparm -A 0 /dev/sda
# -a: Get/set  sector  count  for  filesystem  (software) read-ahead.

# Display some basic settings
$ hdparm -v /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 multcount     =  0 (off)
 IO_support    =  1 (32-bit)
 readonly      =  0 (off)

# -B: Get/set  Advanced  Power  Management  feature, if the drive supports it. A low value means aggressive power management and a high
      value means better performance.  Possible settings range from values 1 through 127  (which  permit  spin-down),  and  values  128
      through  254  (which  do  not permit spin-down).  The highest degree of power management is attained with a setting of 1, and the
      highest I/O performance with a setting of 254.  A value of 255 tells hdparm to disable Advanced Power  Management  altogether  on
      the drive (not all drives support disabling it, but most do)

# -C: Check  the  current IDE power mode status, which will always be one of unknown (drive does not support this command), active/idle
      (normal operation), standby (low power mode, drive has spun down), or sleeping (lowest  power  mode,  drive  is  completely  shut
      down).  The -S, -y, -Y, and -Z options can be used to manipulate the IDE power modes.

# -r: Get/set read-only flag for the device.  When set, Linux disallows write operations on the device.

# -R: Get/set Write-Read-Verify feature, if the drive supports it.  Usage: -R0 (disable) or -R1 (enable).

# --read-sector: Reads from the specified sector number, and dumps the contents in hex to standard  output.

# -m: Get/set sector count for multiple sector I/O on the drive.  A setting of 0 disables this feature.
#     Permit the transfer of multiple sectors per I/O interrupt, rather than the usual one sector per interrupt.

# -W: Get/set the IDE/SATA driveÂ´s write-caching feature.

# --fwdownload file_path: When used, this should be the only option given. The contents of this file will be sent to the drive using the
#                         (S)ATA DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command, using either transfer protocol 7 (entire file at once), or, if the drive
#                         supports it, transfer protocol 3 (segmented download).

# --security-help: Display terse usage info for all of the --security-* options.
# --security-set-pass PWD:
#      Lock  the  drive, using password PWD (Set Password) (DANGEROUS).  Password is given as an ASCII string and is padded with NULs to
#      reach 32 bytes.  Use the special password NULL to set an empty password.  The applicable drive  password  is  selected  with  the
#      --user-master  switch  (default  is  "user" password) and the applicable security mode with the --security-mode switch.  No other
#      options are permitted on the command line with this one.
# --user-master USER:
#      Specifies which password (user/master) to select.  Defaults to user password.  Only useful in combination with --security-unlock,
#      --security-set-pass, --security-disable, --security-erase or --security-erase-enhanced.
#         u       user password
#         m       master password
# --security-freeze
# --security-prompt-for-password
# --security-unlock PWD
# --security-disable PWD
# --security-erase PWD
# --security-erase-enhanced PWD
# --security-mode MODE
