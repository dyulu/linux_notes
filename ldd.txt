In Linux, library files are commonly located in /lib or /usr/lib directories

sudo apt-get install libc-bin
ldd [options] executable

-v – Verbose mode, which prints all information.
-u – Shows unused direct dependencies
-d – Executes data relocation and shows missing ELF objects.
-r – executes data and function relocation and shows missing ELF objects and functions.

ldd prints the shared objects (shared libraries) required by each program or shared object specified on the command line
ldd shows the entire dependency tree of the executable
Never employ ldd on an untrusted executable, since this may result in the execution of arbitrary code
Safer alternative when dealing with untrusted executables (only the direct dependencies of the executable):
    objdump -p /path/to/program | grep NEEDED


# virtual dynamic shared object (vdso)
# path of the ELF interpreter that is hardcoded into the executabl
# memory at which the library is loaded
$ ldd /bin/bash
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff478e7000)
	libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007f5e4a142000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f5e49f3e000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f5e49b4d000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f5e4a686000)

$ objdump -p /bin/bash | grep NEEDED
