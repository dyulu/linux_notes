==== tmux: terminal multiplexer, offer window management and session management
Allow creation of multiple windows and panes within a single terminal window
Keep these windows and panes in a session
Allow exiting a session, i.e., detaching and then attaching later
Session is kept alive until tmux server is killed, e.g., reboot

When working with remote servers over ssh, if ssh connection is lost
    tmux session is simply detached but kept running in the background
    can ssh to the server again and attach to the running session
    all the processes that were running in the session are still alive
