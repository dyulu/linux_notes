# Find Which Process Accessing a Directory or a file/filesystem
fuser dir_name       # Print the PIDs of the processes currently accessing dir_name
fuser -v dir_name    # -v: verbose;  the process owner (USER), process ID (PID), the access type (ACCESS) and command (COMMAND)
                     # Under the ACCESS column, see access types signified by the following letters:
                     #   c – current directory
                     #   e – an executable file being run
                     #   f – open file, however, f is left out in the output
                     #   F – open file for writing, F is as well excluded from the output
                     #   r – root directory

# Kill and Signal Processes

# Identify process using a TCP socket:
fuser -n tcp port#

# fuser show which processes use the named files, sockets, or filesystems.
  -a,--all              display unused files too
  -i,--interactive      ask before killing (ignored without -k)
  -k,--kill             kill processes accessing the named file
  -l,--list-signals     list available signal names
  -m,--mount            show all processes using the named filesystems or block device
  -M,--ismountpoint     fulfill request only if NAME is a mount point
  -n,--namespace SPACE  search in this name space (file, udp, or tcp)
  -s,--silent           silent operation
  -SIGNAL               send this signal instead of SIGKILL
  -u,--user             display user IDs
  -v,--verbose          verbose output
  -w,--writeonly        kill only processes with write access
  -V,--version          display version information
  -4,--ipv4             search IPv4 sockets only
