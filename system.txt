# Dependencies: Wants= and Requires= do not imply After=
# Unit A requires Unit B to be running before A is started: in [Unit] section of A, add
Requires=B
After=B
# If dependency is optional
Wants=B
After=B
# Dependencies are typically placed on services and not on targets
# For example, network.target is pulled in by whatever service configures your network interfaces, therefore
# ordering your custom unit after it is sufficient since network.target is started anyway

# To delay a service until after the network is up, include the following dependencies in the .service file
[Unit]
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

# Service types: [Service] section, Type= parameter
Type=simple (default): systemd considers the service to be started up immediately. The process must not fork.
                       Do not use this type if other services need to be ordered on this service, unless it is socket activated.
Type=forking: systemd considers the service started up once the process forks and the parent has exited.
              For classic daemons use this type unless you know that it is not necessary.
              You should specify PIDFile= as well so systemd can keep track of the main process.
Type=oneshot: this is useful for scripts that do a single job and then exit. You may want to set RemainAfterExit=yes
              as well so that systemd still considers the service as active after the process has exited.
Type=notify: identical to Type=simple, but with the stipulation that the daemon will send a signal to systemd when it is ready.
              The reference implementation for this notification is provided by libsystemd-daemon.so.
Type=dbus: the service is considered ready when the specified BusName appears on DBus's system bus.
Type=idle: systemd will delay execution of the service binary until all jobs are dispatched.
           Other than that behavior is very similar to Type=simple.

# Targets: systemd uses targets to group units together via dependencies and as standardized synchronization points.
# Get current targets
systemctl list-units --type=target

# Change current target: no effect on the next boot
# start all of the units associated with a target and stop all units that are not part of the dependency tree
systemctl list-dependencies the_target.target
systemctl isolate the_target.target

# Change default target to boot into
# The standard target is default.target, which is a symlink to graphical.target
systemctl get-default
systemctl set-default <target>
# Alternatively, append one of the following kernel parameters to your bootloader:
systemd.unit=multi-user.target (which roughly corresponds to the old runlevel 3),
systemd.unit=rescue.target (which roughly corresponds to the old runlevel 1).

# Default target order: Systemd chooses the default.target according to the following order:
Kernel parameter shown above
Symlink of /etc/systemd/system/default.target
Symlink of /usr/lib/systemd/system/default.target

find / -name default.target

# Mounting: systemd is in charge of mounting the partitions and filesystems specified in /etc/fstab. The systemd-fstab-generator(8)
# translates all the entries in /etc/fstab into systemd units, this is performed at boot time and whenever the configuration of the
# system manager is reloaded.
