raw <netfn> <cmd> [data]: 

sdr list: get a list of all sensors in these servers and their status

sdr elist: also print sensor number, entity id and instance, and asserted discrete states
    refine the output to see only specific sensors:
          all: All sensor records; All sensors
          full: Full sensor records; Temperature, voltage, and fan sensors
          compact: Compact sensor records; Digital Discrete: failure and presence sensors
          event: Event-only records; Sensors used only for matching with SEL records
          mcloc: MC locator records; Management Controller sensors
          generic: Generic locator records; Generic devices: LEDs
          fru: FRU locator records; FRU devices

sdr entity entity_id: get a list of all sensors related to an entity

sdr type sensor_type: get a list of a particular type of sensors, e.g., temperature, fan, power supply.

sdr info: query the BMC for SDR information

sensor list: list sensors and thresholds in a wide table format

sensor get sensor_id: get information for sensors specified by ID

fru: get built-in FRU and scan for  FRU  locators

sel info: query the BMC for information about the System Event Log (SEL) and its contents

sel list: view a minimal level of SEL detail

sel elist: view a detailed event output. The sel elist command cross-references event records with sensor data records to produce descriptive event output. It takes longer to execute because it has to read from both the SEL and the Static Data Repository (SDR). For increased speed, generate an SDR cache before using the sel elist command.

sel get sel_record_id:  get more detailed information on a particular event

sel clear: clear the SEL

sel delete <SEL Record ID> ... <SEL Record ID>: delete one or more SEL event records

sel save filename: save SEL to file

sel add filename: read event entries from a file and add them to  the  SEL. Record added is  of  type  2  and  is automatically timestamped.

sel writeraw filename: save SEL records to a file in raw, binary  format

sel readraw filename: read and display SEL records from a binary file

sdr dump cached_sdr_file: pre-cache the static data in the SDR so it can be fed back into IPMItool later

ipmitool -S cached_sdr_file sel elist: speed up sel elist command by using Sensor Data Repository (SDR) cache
