Description of the files and their usages:

Note1: i refers to the bank number below.
Note2: See respective BKDGs for the exact bit definitions of the files below
as they mirror the hardware registers.

status:	 Set MCi_STATUS: the bits in that MSR control the error type and
	 attributes of the error which caused the MCE.

misc:	 Set MCi_MISC: provide auxiliary info about the error. It is mostly
	 used for error thresholding purposes and its validity is indicated by
	 MCi_STATUS[MiscV].

synd:	 Set MCi_SYND: provide syndrome info about the error. Only valid on
	 Scalable MCA systems, and its validity is indicated by MCi_STATUS[SyndV].

addr:	 Error address value to be written to MCi_ADDR. Log address information
	 associated with the error.

cpu:	 The CPU to inject the error on.

bank:	 Specify the bank you want to inject the error into: the number of
	 banks in a processor varies and is family/model-specific, therefore, the
	 supplied value is sanity-checked. Setting the bank value also triggers the
	 injection.

flags:	 Injection type to be performed. Writing to this file will trigger a
	 real machine check, an APIC interrupt or invoke the error decoder routines
	 for AMD processors.

	 Allowed error injection types:
	  - "sw": Software error injection. Decode error to a human-readable 
	    format only. Safe to use.
	  - "hw": Hardware error injection. Causes the #MC exception handler to 
	    handle the error. Be warned: might cause system panic if MCi_STATUS[PCC] 
	    is set. Therefore, consider setting (debugfs_mountpoint)/mce/fake_panic 
	    before injecting.
	  - "df": Trigger APIC interrupt for Deferred error. Causes deferred 
	    error APIC interrupt handler to handle the error if the feature is 
	    is present in hardware. 
	  - "th": Trigger APIC interrupt for Threshold errors. Causes threshold 
	    APIC interrupt handler to handle the error.
