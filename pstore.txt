Linux Kernel Persistent Storage File System:
  backed by local non-volatile memory and presented to the running system via traditional filesystem interfaces
  use the ACPI error record serialization table (ERST) to store crash information across a reboot
  store error records when the kernel dies (or reboots or powers off)
  the kernel stuffs the tail of the dmesg, which also contains a stack backtrace, into store

  File systems > Miscellaneous filesystems > Persistent store support
    CONFIG_PSTORE=y
    CONFIG_PSTORE_CONSOLE=y
    CONFIG_PSTORE_RAM=y

Ramoops:
  an oops/panic logger that writes its logs to RAM before the system crashes
  needs a system with persistent RAM so that the content of that area can survive after a restart

  CONFIG_RAMOOPS=y


/sys/fs/pstore/:
  Currently, two filename prefixes are defined:
    dmseg: saved console log
    mce:   architecture-dependent data from fatal hardware error
  Once the information in a file has been read, removing the file will signal to the underlying persistent
    storage device that it can reclaim the space for later re-use

systemd-pstore.service:
    a system service that archives the contents of pstore to other storage, thus preserving the existing
    information contained in the pstore, and clearing pstore storage for future error events.
