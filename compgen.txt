compgen: compgen [-abcdefgjksuv] [-o option] [-A action] [-G globpat] [-W wordlist]  [-F function] [-C command] [-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] [word]
    Display possible completions depending on the options.
    
    Intended to be used from within a shell function generating possible
    completions.  If the optional WORD argument is supplied, matches against
    WORD are generated.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or an error occurs.


-a: names of alias
-b: names of shell builtins
-c: names of all commands
-d: names of directory
-e: names of exported shell variables
-f: names of file and functions
-g: names of groups
-j: names of job
-k: names of Shell reserved words
-s: names of service
-u: names of userAlias names
-v: names of shell variables


-C command: run command in a subshell and use its output as the list of completions
-F function: run shell function in the current shell. Upon its return, retrieve the list of completions from the COMPREPLY array.
-G globpat: The filename expansion pattern globpat is expanded to generate the possible completions.
-P prefix: prefix is added at the beginning of each possible completion after all other options have been applied.
-S suffix: suffix is appended to each possible completion after all other options have been applied.
-W wordlist: The wordlist is split using the characters in the IFS special variable as delimiters, and each resultant word is expanded. The possible completions are the members of the resultant list which match the word being completed.
-X filterpat: filterpat is a pattern as used for filename expansion. It is applied to the list of possible completions generated by the preceding options and arguments, and each completion matching filterpat is removed from the list. A leading ‘!’ in filterpat negates the pattern; in this case, any completion not matching filterpat is removed.
