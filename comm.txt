# With no options, produce three-column output. Column one contains lines unique to FILE1,
# column two contains lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files.
       -1     suppress column 1 (lines unique to FILE1)
       -2     suppress column 2 (lines unique to FILE2)
       -3     suppress column 3 (lines that appear in both files)
